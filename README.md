## About Cadillac

Cadillac is a division of the American automobile manufacturer General Motors (GM) that designs and builds luxury vehicles. Founded in 1902, Cadillac is among the oldest automobile brands in the world, second in the United States only to fellow GM marque Buick. Cadillac has become a globally recognized luxury automotive brand, known for its innovative engineering, distinctive design language, and technological advancements.

## Generations

- **Early Years (1902-1927)**: Founded by Henry Leland from the remains of the Henry Ford Company, Cadillac quickly established itself as a leader in precision manufacturing. The brand introduced the first electric self-starter, electric lights, and the V8 engine to the automotive market. In 1909, Cadillac was acquired by General Motors and positioned as the company's prestige automobile.

- **Art and Colour Era (1927-1940)**: Under the design leadership of Harley Earl, Cadillac embraced a more artistic approach to automobile design. This period saw the introduction of the LaSalle, styled by Earl, which helped establish Cadillac's reputation for distinctive styling.

- **Post-War Expansion (1946-1959)**: After World War II, Cadillac entered a golden age characterized by iconic tailfins, increasing dimensions, and powerful V8 engines. The 1959 Cadillac, with its enormous tailfins and dual bullet taillights, became a symbol of American prosperity and excess.

- **Modern Luxury Period (1960-1979)**: Cadillac maintained its position as America's luxury leader while gradually evolving its design language. The Eldorado models of this era, particularly the 1967 front-wheel-drive Eldorado, represented significant engineering achievements.

- **Downsizing and Transition (1980-1996)**: In response to fuel economy concerns and changing market preferences, Cadillac significantly reduced the size of its vehicles. This period was challenging for the brand as it struggled to maintain its luxury identity while meeting new regulatory requirements.

- **Art & Science Design (1997-2015)**: Cadillac introduced a bold, angular design philosophy known as "Art & Science," first seen on the 1999 Evoq concept and later implemented on the 2003 CTS. This distinctive approach, combined with improved performance, helped reestablish Cadillac's prominence in the luxury market.

- **Global Luxury Brand (2016-Present)**: Cadillac has focused on expanding its global presence, particularly in China, while continuing to evolve its design language and embrace new technologies. The introduction of the Escalade SUV became a significant success, and the brand has committed to an all-electric future with models like the LYRIQ and CELESTIQ.
